ModuleIsotopeXCheckout
======================

An advanced checkout module for Isotope eCommerce. Uses AJAX to load shipping and payment modules for a nice one or two-screen checkout process.

General Usage
-------------
- Creating guest members: Requires isotope\_member extension in order to process guest account creation. Be sure to enable "Create member: Guest" in your store config until isotope\_member supports the guest option. XCheckout adds in password fields to the billing address during checkout to allow the guest to set their own account password.
- Note that with this extension members will be automatically activated. Will make this a configurable option
